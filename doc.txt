//here we will use express postgresql docker for porper backend setup which will run in every system


setup for docker :
-------------------------------------------------------------

Install Docker Desktop

Run the downloaded installer .exe.

During installation:

Check “Install required Windows components for WSL 2” if you are on Windows Home.

Leave other options default unless you want to change paths.

Click Install → wait until it finishes.

Click Close and restart your computer if prompted.

1️⃣ Check if Docker is working

Open your terminal and run:

docker --version


You should see something like:

Docker version 24.0.0, build xxxxx


Then check if Docker can run containers:

docker run hello-world


This will pull a test image and run it.

If it works, Docker is installed and running properly.
-------------

C:\Users\pramendra singh>docker run hello-world Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally

Ah! That message is normal the first time you run it. Let me explain step by step.

When you run:

docker run hello-world


Docker looks for the hello-world:latest image locally on your machine.

Since it’s not there yet (Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally), Docker automatically downloads it from Docker Hub.

After downloading, it runs the container and prints a “Hello from Docker!” message.

So, this message is not an error, it’s just telling you it’s fetching the image.

✅ Next steps:

Wait a few seconds for Docker to download the image and run it.

You should see output like this:

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.


If you see that, Docker is installed and working fine.

After that, we can move to running PostgreSQL in Docker and connecting to it.
